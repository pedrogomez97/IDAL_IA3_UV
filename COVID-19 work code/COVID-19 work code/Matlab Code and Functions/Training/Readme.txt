*****Image preprocessing steps:

Re-sizing the images:
1. Please open imageBatchProcessor App and show the directory of the image.
2. In the function name tab, please show "image preprocessing" function and press "process all".
3. Export result of all processed images to file


Augmenting the images for training:
1. Please open imageBatchProcessor App and show the directory of the image.
2. In the function name tab, please show "image augmentation" function and press "process all".
3. Export result of all processed images to file


*****Image training & testing steps:


Images training steps:
1. Load "train" folder where different class will be different subfolders, and run "Script for training pretrained model.m" code.
2.Change the network name in code for training with different network.For installing different pretrained CNN network in Matlab follow

Images testing:
1. Load "test" folder where different class will be different subfolders, and run "Script for testing and plotting confusion matrix.m" code
